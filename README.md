# Blockchain-Based Memory and Identity Preservation System

A comprehensive smart contract system built on the Stacks blockchain for preserving digital identity, verifying memory authenticity, and protecting against memory manipulation.

## Overview

This system consists of five interconnected smart contracts that work together to create a robust framework for memory and identity preservation:

1. **Digital Legacy Management Contract** - Preserves and manages digital identity after death
2. **Memory Authenticity Verification Contract** - Distinguishes between real and artificially implanted memories
3. **Identity Continuity Tracking Contract** - Maintains personal identity through radical life changes
4. **Collective Memory Preservation Contract** - Safeguards cultural and historical memories from manipulation
5. **Trauma-Informed Memory Management Contract** - Protects individuals from harmful memory manipulation

## Key Features

### Digital Legacy Management
- Secure storage of digital assets and identity markers
- Automated inheritance and access control
- Verification of death certificates and legal documentation
- Time-locked access for beneficiaries

### Memory Authenticity Verification
- Cryptographic proof of memory authenticity
- Timestamp verification for memory creation
- Source validation and chain of custody
- Detection of artificially implanted memories

### Identity Continuity Tracking
- Immutable record of identity changes over time
- Verification of identity transitions
- Protection against identity theft
- Continuity scoring system

### Collective Memory Preservation
- Decentralized storage of cultural memories
- Community consensus mechanisms
- Protection against historical revisionism
- Democratic governance for memory validation

### Trauma-Informed Memory Management
- Consent-based memory access controls
- Therapeutic intervention protocols
- Privacy protection for sensitive memories
- Recovery-oriented memory management

## Technical Architecture

### Data Structures
- **Identity Records**: Immutable identity snapshots with timestamps
- **Memory Fragments**: Cryptographically signed memory units
- **Legacy Vaults**: Encrypted storage for digital assets
- **Consensus Records**: Community-validated historical events
- **Trauma Markers**: Protected indicators for sensitive content

### Security Features
- Multi-signature authentication
- Time-locked access controls
- Cryptographic proof of authenticity
- Decentralized consensus mechanisms
- Privacy-preserving protocols

## Contract Interactions

Each contract operates independently but can reference data from others through read-only functions. The system maintains data integrity through:

- Immutable record keeping
- Cryptographic verification
- Community consensus
- Time-based validation
- Multi-party authentication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet CLI
- Node.js 18+
- Stacks wallet for testing

### Installation

\`\`\`bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd memory-identity-blockchain
npm install
clarinet check
\`\`\`

### Testing

\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

### Deployment

\`\`\`bash
clarinet deploy --testnet
\`\`\`

## Usage Examples

### Registering a Digital Legacy
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .digital-legacy register-legacy
"identity-hash"
"encrypted-assets"
(list beneficiary-1 beneficiary-2))
\`\`\`

### Verifying Memory Authenticity
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .memory-authenticity verify-memory
"memory-hash"
"signature"
block-height)
\`\`\`

### Tracking Identity Changes
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .identity-continuity record-change
"old-identity"
"new-identity"
"verification-proof")
\`\`\`

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted before storage
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Time-locked access prevents premature disclosure
- Community consensus protects against manipulation
- Trauma-informed design prioritizes user safety
